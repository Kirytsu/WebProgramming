                Brief History of Jakarta
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, has a rich and diverse history that reflects its strategic importance in Southeast Asia. Originally a small port town known as Sunda Kelapa, it was an important trading hub for the Hindu Sunda Kingdom in the 14th century. In 1527, the city was renamed Jayakarta after local forces, led by Fatahillah, expelled Portuguese traders, marking the city's rise in importance.
                <br><br>
                In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company seized control and renamed the city Batavia, making it the center of their colonial administration in the Dutch East Indies. Batavia thrived as a key trading city but was also known for its ethnic diversity, with communities of Javanese, Chinese, Indian, and European settlers living within its walls.

                During World War II, Japan occupied Indonesia, and after the war, Indonesia declared independence in 1945. Batavia was renamed Jakarta, and it became the political, economic, and cultural heart of the newly independent nation.
                <br><br>
                Today, Jakarta is a bustling metropolis, home to over 10 million people. It is known for its rapid urbanization, diverse population, and status as Indonesia's financial and political hub. Despite its modern skyscrapers and infrastructure, the city retains elements of its historical heritage through its architecture, cultural landmarks, and museums.
